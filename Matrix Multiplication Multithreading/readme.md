Use multi-threading to multiply two square matrices of size N (N is passed to your object via a construction). Populate the matrices with random integers in [0, 100]. We are interested in two things: the way the execution time varies with (a) the input size and (b) the number of threads. So, along with your source file (eem514_groupno_04a.java), you will also plot and submit two graphs (saved as .png images): (a) exec time versus input size (N) of sequential versus multi-threaded for a fixed number of threads (say 4, or 8 – set this value depending on how the results turn out on your system), and (b) exec time versus number of threads (2,4,6,8…) for a fixed input size (again, fix N as you find suitable).
